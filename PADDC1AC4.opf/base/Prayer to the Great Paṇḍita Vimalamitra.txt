Prayer to the Great Paṇḍita Vimalamitra
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

pakyul khepé tsukgyen pandita
Paṇḍita who adorned the crowns of scholars from the noble land,
drimé shenyen tek chok tenpé dak
Vimalamitra, master of the teachings of the supreme vehicle,
jalü dorjé ku chok nyepa la
Who attained the supreme vajra form of the rainbow body—
solwa deb so jingyi lab tu sol
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessings!

Chökyi Lodrö wrote this for Sogyal while travelling along the Ganges river.
